Chapter 4

Batman, after heroically escaping his imprisonment, goes to mess Bane the f*** up. He arrives just in the nick of time as Bane and his
goons go to war with the city police. Batman joins the fight and manages to break Bane's stupid Darth-Vader rip-off mask thinga-ma-jig,
but it's not enough because TALIA AL GUHL BITCHES. She stabs Batman in the back (hehe) and helps activate a nuke that they had stolen,
so Batman kicks their butts and heroically flies the nuke off into the sunset, dying in the process. But of course, he didn't actually die
cause, ya know, he's Batman.
